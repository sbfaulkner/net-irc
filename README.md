# Net::IRC

TODO: determine whether to go by net-irc, sbfaulkner-net-irc, or ruby-net-irc.

A ruby implementation of the IRC client protocol.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'net-irc'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install net-irc

## Example

The gem installs the nicl command-line client (pronounced "nickle", as in worth about a...). This client is strictly intended as a sample usage of and testbed for Net::IRC, and is not meant as an example of how to write a command-line
client.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
